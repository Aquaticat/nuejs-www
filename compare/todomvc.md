  ## What are we comparing? [what]
  [Todo MVC](https://todomvc.com/) is a project to showcase a same Todo application, but implemented with different frontend frameworks. It helps developers to choose a framework to go with. This comparison shows how Nue differs from React and Vue.

  Online versions:

  * [React](//jacob-ebey.js.org/hooks-todo/)
  * [Vue][vue] (in codesandbox.io)
  * [Nue](//nuejs.org/todomvc/)

  [vue]: //codesandbox.io/s/github/blacksonic/todomvc-vue-composition-api

  ## What is the key difference? [key-difference]
  React and Vue use JavaScript to assemble everything together and the code contains framework-specific idioms like hooks, actions, and reducers.

  Nue uses HTML- based syntax with minimal JavaScript that is better suited for UX developers dealing with the [front of the frontend](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)
