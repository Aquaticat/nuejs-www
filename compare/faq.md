# Compare FAQ

## Are we comparing apples-to-apples? [apples]
We are comparing tools that attempt to solve the same problem but in a different way. You decide.

## Why size is important? [size]
Smaller projects are:

1. Easier to use
1. Easier to develop
1. More stable
1. Faster to execute

[Learn the details](/why/#minimalism) on why minimalism is important in software development.


## How is Nue 10 – 100× smaller? [small]
Three reasons:

1. *Focus*: Nue projects typically focus on one thing only
1. *Simplicity*: Nue internals are meant to be as simple as possible
1. *No TypeScript*: Nue embraces the dynamic typing in JavaScript






## Why compare to Headless UI? [headless]
[Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) is a popular, well-known project that gives a good idea of present-day component development and you'll find implementations for *React*, *Vue*, and [Svelte](https://github.com/rgossiaux/svelte-headlessui).

## Why the listbox component? [listbox]
Because it is somewhere in the middle in terms of size and complexity. There are components like [radio group](https://headlessui.com/react/radio-group) that would favor Nue significantly more (closer to 100× ratio)

## Why compare front pages? [homepage]
They are great examples to showcase how a specific tool or ecosystem is used in real life.


## Why Tailwind front page? [tailwind]
Because Next.js website is not open source and Tailwind is.
