  ## What are we comparing? [what]
  The focus of this comparison is to take a look at how to implement content-heavy web pages that contain interactive elements and have multiple distinct sections with a custom layout.

  ## Why Tailwind and Astro? [why]
  Tailwind users Next.js under the hood, which is the most popular React- framework currently. It is a good example to show how rich pages are implemented these days.

  Astro is an emerging framework with a focus on content-heavy web pages. It is the closest alternative to the upcoming [Nuekit](/tools/#nuekit) project.


  ## What is the key difference? [key-difference]
  Next.js and Astro use TypeScript to assemble everything together.

  Nue uses [Nuemark](/tools/#nuemark) for assembling content-heavy pages, regardless of the complexity. Nue takes a strong stance on separating content, layout, style, and logic so that they are easier to edit.
