# Website performance
Nue is fast by default. It's almost impossible to build a slow website with Nue.


## Load less resources
Nue takes a simple path to performance: load less stuff. Here's a comparison of the blog starter template [made with Next.js](//next-blog-starter.vercel.app/) vs [made with Nue](//nuejs.org/@nextjs-blog/):

## Simple performance optimization
Reach the highest performance scores with simple configuration options for CSS inlining and pre-fetching:

``` yaml
inline_css: true
prefetch_global_css: true
preload_images: [ my-hero.webp ]
page_router: true
```


## Cache- friendly
Nue defaults to [unbundled distribution](../concepts/js-modules#unbundled) so only the files that have changed are loaded from the server. Others remain in cache.
