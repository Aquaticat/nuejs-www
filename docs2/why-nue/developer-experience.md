# Greatly Improved Developer Experience

## Universal hot reloading
*If you had to pick only one reason to use Nue, it's this one:*

[.subtle]
  Make changes to your your content, layout, styling, or interactive islands and Nue magically keeps your browser in sync




## Websites and web applications
Use the same syntax and simple programming style for both multi-page, and single-page applications:

[media]
  small: /img/simple-blog.png
  large: /img/simple-blog-big.png
  href: /@simple-blog
  width: 650

Simple Blog:
[Demo](/@simple-blog) /
[How to build](../tutorials/build-a-simple-blog) /
[Source code @ Github](//github.com/...)

[media]
  small: /img/simple-spa.png
  large: /img/simple-spa-big.png
  href: /@simple-admin
  width: 650

Simple SPA:
[Demo](/@simple-admin) /
[How to build](../tutorials/build-a-simple-spa) /
[Source code @ Github](//github.com/...)




## Write less code
Nue has [far less abstractions](standards-based.html#less-abstractions) so you typically need less code and effort to implement the same app:

  small: /img/less-to-code.png
  large: /img/less-to-code-big.png
  class: wide

2 x 2 links to demos & source code



## Extremely fast build times
Nue is orders of maginitude faster than it's cousins:

## Start small and grow from there
With Nue, there is no fixed folder structure. Start with `index.md` and grow naturally from there with hot-reloading on your back.
