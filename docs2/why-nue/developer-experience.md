# Greatly Improved Developer Experience

## Universal hot reloading
If you had to pick only one reason to use Nue, it's this one:

![video here](/docs/img/stripes.jpg)


Make changes to your your content, layout, styling, or interactive islands and your browser is constantly in sync as you move forward. This is probably the biggest development booster in Nue.


## Websites and web applications
Use the same syntax and simple programming style for both multi-page, and single-page applications:

! SPA & MPA

2 x 2 links to demos & source code




## Write less code
Nue has [far less abstractions](standards-based.html#less-abstractions) so you typically need less code and effort to implement the same app:

  large: /img/less-to-code-big.png
  class: tall

2 x 2 links to demos & source code



## Extremely fast build times
Nue is order of maginitued faster than it's cousins:

## Start small and grow from there
With Nue, there is no fixed folder structure. Start with `index.md` and grow naturally from there with hot-reloading on your back.
