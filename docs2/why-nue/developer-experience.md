# Greatly Improved Developer Experience

## Universal hot reloading
If you had to pick only one reason to use Nue, it's this one:

![video here](/docs/img/stripes.jpg)


Make changes to your your content, layout, styling, or interactive islands and your browser is constantly in sync as you move forward. This is probably the biggest development booster in Nue.


## Start small, grow fast
Start with `index.html` or `index.md` and grow from there with hot-reloading on your back:

! Directory layout: page -> blog -> hybrid
  Freely add new apps as you grow. There is no fixed folder structure.


## Write less code
Nue has [far less abstractions](standards-based.html#less-abstractions) so you typically need less code and effort to implement the same app:

! next.js vs nue.js

2 x 2 links to demos & source code


## Websites and web applications
Use the same syntax and simple programming style for both multi-page, and single-page applications:

! SPA & MPA

2 x 2 links to demos & source code


## Extremely fast build times
Nue is order of maginitued faster than it's cousins:
