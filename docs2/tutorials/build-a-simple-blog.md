## Install Nue
First install Nue, if not installed yet:

``` sh
# With Bun (recommended)
bun install --global nue

# With Node
node install --global nue
```

## Create your first page
Next we create a folder for our blog and add a page in there:

``` sh
# create a folder for our blog
mkdir simple-blog

# go to the directory
cd simple-blog

# create the first page
echo '# Hello, World!' > index.md
```

Congrats! Your first Nue application is ready üçªüçª

You can start developing it with `nue` command:

```
nue
```

Open `http://localhost:8080/` with your browser and you'll see this:

! browser: Hello, World?


## HTML source
Let's view the source code of that page at `view-source:http://localhost:8080/`

```
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello, World!</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
    <script src="/@nue/ƒ±hotreload.jsƒ±" type="module"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Nue auto-generates a HTML skeleton, with basic meta tags and the page title, which is automatically parsed from the Markdown content.

The nicest thing, however, is the "hotreload.js" module, which is the #1 reason to choose Nue as your web development environment. Lets see how it works.


## Hot-reloading
Lets add a new file to our project folder called "blog.css", which will take care of the styling. Nue automatically adds the following line on the HTML without the need to reload your page:

```
<link href="/blog.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Now, as you edit either of your files (blog.css or index.md) on your text editor you can see the browser magically morphing with your changes:

! video: completing the page the first page

Instead making a full reload, Nue uses a technique called **DOM diffing** to only update the parts on the page that have changed. Be it the content, metadata, styling, global headers and footers, page layouts, or a reactive components.


## Front matter
Next we add some metadata for the page for SEO and social sharing purposes. We do this by adding a so called "front matter" in the beginning of our Markdown page. This is a YAML- formatted section with human-readable key/value pairs:

```
 ---
 title: My first Nue page
 description: Fooling around with hot-reloading
 ---

 # Hello, World!

```

Again, as you edit the metadata you can see your page title change on the browser tab.


## Complete the page
Then we add a folder called `img` to hold all our images and complete editing the content and styling until we are happy. And we can watch the page evolve on the browser from start to finish in a "What you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) manner.

! final page design



## Add headers and footers
Next we stop fooling around and turn our blog to something more serious. We start by adding headers and footers by creating a file called `layout.html` on the project root and edit it as follows:

```
<!-- global header -->
<header>
  <a href="/"><img :src="avatar"></a>
  <nav>
    <a :for="el in social" :href="el.url">
      <img class="icon" src="/img/{el.icon}.svg">
    </a>
  </nav>
</header>

<!-- global footer -->
<footer>
  <p>¬© { fullname } ‚Ä¢ { new Date().getFullYear() }</p>
  <q>{ slogan }</q>
</footer>
```


## Add shared data
Then we add a data file called "site.yaml" with all the site-wide data to fill our personal information and othe basic data being used on our header and footer:

``` yaml
# shared data for all paegs
fullname: Emma Bennet
slogan: Less is More
avatar: /img/emma.jpg
favicon: /img/favicon.jpg


# the social icons on the header
social:
  - icon: email
    url: email:emma@bennet.co
    alt: Emma Bennet email address
  - icon: twitter
    url: //twitter.com/tipiirai
    alt: Twitter profile
  - icon: github
    url: //github.com/nuejs/
    alt: Github projects
```

You can see your page headers and footers update on your browser as you edit the layout or the data file.


## Add more pages
Next we add two more pages to the directory. Each one will automatically share the same header, footer, and styling.  Here's what our website looks at this point:

! 3 x pages

Pretty good. Of course hot-reloading was there to provide a great content authoring and styling experience for all the pages.


## Create blog index
Next we move all our pages to "posts" folder to make room to our new front page, which lists all our entries from newest to latest:

! New folder structure

Here's our new front page / index.md:

``` md
 ---
 title: Emma Bennet Blog
 description: Writing on design, UX engineering, minimalism, and product thinking
 content_collection: posts
 ---

 # Minimalist, UX engineer, designer, urban explorer.
 I‚Äôm Emma Bennett, a user experience designer and developer from Berlin. Here  are my thoughts on design, UX engineering, and product thinking.
```

The page is configured with a new [content collection](content-collections) option to hold information of all our posts. We use this information to render the posts on our updated `layout.html` file:

```
<!-- front page main layout -->
<main>
  <!-- slot for the Markdown content -->
  <slot for="content"/>

  <!-- list of blog posts by looping the "posts" variable  -->
  <a :for="post in posts" :href="post.url">
    <img src="{ post.dir }/{ post.hero }">
    <aside>
      <h2>{ post.title }</h2>
      <p>{ post.description }</p>
    </aside>
  </a>
</main>

<!-- headers and footers like before -->
<header>
  ...
</header>

<footer>
  ...
</footer>
```

## Blog post layout
Nue treats our "posts" directory as a separate *multi-page application* that can be configured with it's own layout and styling. Here's our post specific main layout that overrides the global one:

```
<!-- posts/layout.html -->
<main>

  <h1>{ title }</h1>

  <p>
    <pretty-date :date/> (by AI) ‚Ä¢
    Photo credits: <a href="//dribbble.com/{ credits }">{ credits }</a>
  </p>

  <img class="hero" :src="hero" width="1000" height="800" alt="Hero image for { title }">

  <article>
    <slot for="content"/>
  </article>

</main>
```

The header and footer are inherited from the root level `layout.html`


## Add a reactive "island"
Next we add an interactive feedback component that can be opened from a chat icon on the bottom/right corner of the page.

! img: feedback component

Lets create the interactive feedback component with the same Nue template syntax that is used for defining the server-side layouts:

```
<!-- file: feedback.nue -->

<dialog @name="feedback-dialog">
  <a class="close" @click="root.close()">&times;</a>

  <div :if="thanks" class="thanks">
    <h2>Thank you!</h2>
  </div>

  <form @submit.prevent="submit" :else>
    <h2>Give us feedback</h2>

    <div>
      <h3>Your name</h3>
      <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Example: John Doe" required>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Your email</h3>
      <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="your@email.com" required>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Your thoughts</h3>
      <textarea name="feedback" placeholder="Type here..."/>
    </div>

    <button>Submit</button>

  </form>

  <script>
    submit({ target }) {
      this.thanks = true
    }
  </script>

</dialog>
```

Then we add the component to the footer and add a trigger element that opens up the dialog:

```
<!-- file: ./layout.html -->

<footer>
  <a href="/">¬© { fullname }</a>
  <strong>{ slogan }</strong>

  <!-- feedback dialog is automatically mounted here -->
  <feedback-dialog id="feedback"/>

  <!-- feedback launcher using the native .showModal() method -->
  <img src="/img/feedback.svg" onclick="feedback.showModal()">
</footer>
```

Needless to say, that hot-reloading facility is there again to speed up development. The dialog is not only updating live, but the also the potential form values are retained and the dialog remains open while we make changes.


## Optimize for production
Our blog is now ready. It's time to build a minified production version:

``` sh
nue build --production
```

! video


We can also preview the production version at `http://localhost:8081`

``` sh
nue serve --production
```

You can now push the production version at `.dist/prod` to some public server. You currently need to do this manually before the official deployement tool is available.
