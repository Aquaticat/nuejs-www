# The closer-to-standards web framework
Nue is a simple **Next.js**, and **Astro** alternative focusing on *minimalism*, *separation of concerns*, and *semantic web design*.

## What is Nue? [tools]
Nue offers all the essentials for standards-based web development:

[.tools]
  * `HTML`
    ### Nue JS
    Build user interfaces with obvious, HTML-based markup

    [A (2.3kb) alternative](/docs/nuejs/) to *React*, *Vue*, and *Svelte*

  * `CSS`
    ### Nue CSS
    Bring back the power of modular, cascaded styling.

    Standards-based alternative to *Tailwind* and other *CSS-in-JS* libs

  * `M‚Üì`
    ### Nuemark
    Bring back content-first approach to web development.

    Semantic alternative to *Headless UI* and *Shadcn UI*

  * `HTML`
    ### Nue UI [ui]
    Small, standards-based, and themable UI library.


    Rich, human alternative to *Markdown*, *MDX* and *Markdoc*

  * `MVC`
    ### Nue MVC
    Model-view-controller: separate your view from the business logic.

    Common sense alternative to *React router*, *Redux*, and *Pinia*

// ## Why nue?

    text: I'm really rooting for your project to grow. I'm very excited about its concept. Because I think no framework has it figured out yet, so I really welcome every new solution to make web dev easier.

    text: It's funny how React and other frameworks spent so much effort abstracting the render loop, meanwhile Nue is just like "call update()". And in the end, Nue looks a lot simpler to use.
