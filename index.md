  ![Elliot profile image]( /home/img/elliot-jay-stocks.jpg)

  > At some point in the last decade, popular frameworks and platforms have eschewed semantic markup and, as a result, the web has become way more bloated than it ever needed to be. Stripping away presentational markup and unreadable CSS is something all web developers once believed in.

  > **I'm glad Nue is bringing back that power.**

    text: It's funny how React and other frameworks spent so much effort abstracting the render loop, meanwhile Nue is just like "call update()". And in the end, Nue looks a lot simpler to use.
