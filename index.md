# Frontend *Troublemaker*
**Nue** is a powerful **React, Vue, Next.js, Vite**, and **Astro** alternative. It might *change the way you develop for the web.*

[.hello]
  ### Hello, World!
  Author here. I've been working on this for the past year or so, lately full-time. There are two things here:

  1. [Nue JS](/docs/nuejs/) ‚Äî A tiny (2.3kb minzipped) JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's like React/Vue, but there are no hooks, effects, props, or other unusual abstractions on your way. Know the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and you are good to go. It supports both server-side rendering and client-side reactive components. It takes inspiration from Vue 2.0 and Riot.js. (I'm the original author of Riot).

  2. [Nue tools](//nuejs.org/tools/) ‚Äî A complete frontend development toolset. Once finished, Nue is an alternative to systems like Vite, Next.js, and Astro. This is the ultimate goal.

  The thing is that I'm not happy with the current state of web development, so I'm building everything from scratch in a super minimalistic way *to make things easier for web developers*. I'm taking advantage of the "old school" innovations like progressive enhancement, separation of concerns, and semantic web design. All the benefits are highlighted [here](/why/).

  Some first reactions in [Hacker News][hn], [GitHub][gh], and [Reddit][reddit].

  It looks like developers are loving Nue, so I'm super motivated and committed to completing all items on the [roadmap](/tools/). All projects are released under the MIT license.

  **Thank You!** ‚ù§Ô∏è

    text: It's funny how React and other frameworks spent so much effort abstracting the render loop, meanwhile Nue is just like "call update()". And in the end, Nue looks a lot simpler to use.
