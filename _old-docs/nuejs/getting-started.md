title: Nue JS â€¢ Getting started
---

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the command line
- Install [Bun](//bun.sh) or [Node](//nodejs.org/en)
- [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yaoyuanzhang.nue&ssr=false) Visual Studio users (optional)


## Option 1: create-nue
[create-nue](//github.com/nuejs/create-nue) repository is the best way to familiarize yourself to Nue JS. Get it as follows:

``` sh
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nuejs/create-nue.git --depth 1

# cd to your newly created app
cd create-nue

# remove git directory
rm -rf .git

# install dependencies
npm install

# Build demo site and start a HTTP server
npm run start

# Open the demo on the browser
open "http://localhost:8080"
```

After the start command you'll have a demo under the folder `create-nue/www` and it is served locally on port 8080. It will look like this:

Look for the documented scripts under the `scripts` folder on how to do server-side rendering and client-side compilation.

~NOTE:~ create-nue is constantly updated as the [Nue toolset](/tools/) makes progress. Ultimately the demo website is generated by the upcoming web application builder (Nuekit), but for now, it's just sample scripts to understand how Nue JS works.

~NOTE 2:~ A proper `npm create nue <destination>` command is coming soon

## Option 2: npm install
Install Nue JS via npm, pnpm, or bun

```
npm install nuejs-core
```

After installing, you can import the main functions into your  JavaScript or TypeScript files:

```
import { render, parse, compile } from 'nuejs-core'
```

Then learn [component basics](component-basics.html) how to do [server-side rendering](server-components.html) and how to use [reactive components](reactive-components.html).
