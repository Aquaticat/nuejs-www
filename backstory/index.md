# Backstory

When I was a CPO at Flowplayer, Muut, and Volument, I faced serious problems in front-end development. While projects started nicely, they soon became hard to maintain. After a few months of development, the speed slowed down significantly and some parts of the project were stuck. Due to absurd levels of complexity and bloat the team spirit was lost. It was a sad experience. hhere

Frontend development is having a crisis: I read stories on how developers suffer from [frontend fatigue][fatigue] and its extreme form: [burnout][burnout]. I don't want my career to end like that.

### Because I remember how web development used to be fun! [first]

I still remember the exact moment when I discovered jQuery. It was a revelation: can I suddenly add logic to my pages in the same way I add styling? For sure. "This is going to be huge!"

And it was: in the following years we embraced things like **separation of concerns**, **semantic HTML**, and **progressive enhancement**. Things were great.


### But then it changed [then]

Developers discovered single-page applications and Facebook started dominating how the web was developed. Slowly but steadily JavaScript developers took control of everything: logic, styling, and user experience development. Content-heavy websites were developed like they were single-page apps. Eventually, JS engineers won, [UX developers][divide] lost, and the old foundation was gone.

### But the magic is still there [magic]

First, we must recognize that a content-focused website is a whole different beast than a single-page application. Secondly: we need to understand that UX development is [different][back] from JS development. Their goals, skills, and interests are different.

Nue is an ambitious attempt to fix the status quo. It offers simpler tooling for both JS and UX developers. It brings back the [normal web things][normal] and coins it with the latest web things. It makes web development enjoyable again.

Nue is the front-end troublesolver you've been looking for.
