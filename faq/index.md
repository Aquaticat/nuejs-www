# FAQ

## What is Nue?
*Nue* is the umbrella term for all Nue-related projects. It's a rather ambitious project to build a simpler and more powerful alternative to services like *Vercel*, *Gatsby*, and *Nelify*

## Do we really need another framework? [fatique]
~More than ever!~ We need to radically simplify our stack. There are so many build steps in the current stack that only the more savvy TypeScript engineers can understand how it all works.

With Nue, your stack is not just simpler, but [order of magnitude smaller](/docs/why-nue/closer-to-standards.html#be-closer-to-metal). There are fewer abstractions, less to learn, fewer headaches, and less room for errors. Please read the [backstory](/blog/backstory/) for a deeper rant.



## How is Nue "closer to standards"? [metal]
One of the main goals of Nue is to bring web development closer to standards by focusing on *minimalism*, *separation of concerns*, and *semantic web design*. That is: there are as few abstractions as possible. The layout, styling, and logic are separated, CSS is used as intended, and JavaScript is optional.


## Why the word Nue?
"Nue" comes from the German word "neu", which translates to "new" in English. It is pronounced like `/nju/`.


## Who are you?
I'm [Tero Piirainen](//twitter.com/tipiirai), a frontend developer from *Helsinki*. I've been around for 25+ years building open-source projects and startups. I'm mostly known for [Riot.js](//riot.js.org/), *Flowplayer*, and *jQuery Tools*. Right now I'm focusing solely on Nue.

## Why all the effort? [why]
It's hard to look from aside how web development is slipping away from standards to something more complex, heavy, and proprietary. I do this for pain, not fun. I cannot rest until I'm done.

## Who is Nue inspired by? [Inspiration]
Mostly *Jarred Sumner* for developing [Bun](//bun.sh) â€” a super awesome project to replace the whole Node ecosystem with a faster one. It's a new JavaScript runtime, bundler, test runner, and NPM-compatible package manager. Thanks, Jared for showing how a single developer can pull big dreams!

While Bun makes JavaScript faster, Nue makes front-end development faster. Nue + Bun is really the perfect combination for a front-end developer.

Other people that inspired Nue are:

*Salvatore Sanfilippo* for this action-provoking [tweet][antirez]:

> "I look at the web today. Not as a programmer, but as a user of broken sites that are unable to obey the most basic rules of navigation and usability, terribly slow despite the hardware progress. And I can only think that modern frontend development has failed."

*Steve Jobs* for the phrase:

> "Youâ€™ve got to start with the customer experience and work backward for the technology"

*Dieter Rams* for stating the obvious:

> "Less, but better"
