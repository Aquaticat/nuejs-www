# FAQ

## Who are you?
I'm [Tero Piirainen](//twitter.com/tipiirai), a frontend developer from *Helsinki*. I've been around for 25+ years building open-source projects and startups. I'm mostly known for [Riot.js](//riot.js.org/), *Flowplayer*, and *jQuery Tools*. Right now I'm focusing solely on Nue.


## What is Nue? [nue]
Nue is a "closer-to-standards web framework". The focus is on *minimalism*, *separation of concerns*, and *semantic web design*. That is: there are as little abstractions as possible. The layout, styling, and logic are separated, and CSS is used as intended.


## Why to word Nue?
"Nue" comes from the German word "neu", which translates to "new" in English. It is pronounced like `/nju/`.



## Do we need another framework? [fatique]
We do. Developers are suffering. UX developers in particular. And the role of a web designer is practically gone. There are so many build steps in the current stack that only the more savvy JavaScript engineers can understand. Please read the [backstory](/blog/backstory/) for a deeper rant.

There's also a huge amount of *resistance*: developers have adopted new, nonstandard ways of building things and it's hard/impossible to change their minds. So a lot of time will go into writing. Help needed!




## Can you pull this off? [Doubt]
Yes. The code is mostly there. It just needs to be polished, packaged, and documented. Writing docs and keeping up with the open-source community takes time.




## Why all the effort? [why]
It's hard to look from aside how web development is slipping away from standards to something more complex, heavy, and proprietary. I do this for pain, not fun. I cannot rest until I'm done.


## Can I help? [contribute]
Please do! Send me email: tipiirai @ gmail com.


## What are the guiding principles? [principles]

1. *Separation of concerns*: HTML, CSS, and JS should be separate.
2. *Minimalism*: 10 lines of code is easier to scale than 100 lines of code.
3. *Semantic web design* cascaded stylesheets is a standard. [Tailwind is not](/blog/tailwind-vs-semantic-css/)


## What are the benefits of Nue? [difference]

1. Faster tooling
1. Improved developer experience
1. Slimmer sites

## Who is Nue inspired by? [Inspiration]
Mostly *Jarred Sumner* for developing [Bun](//bun.sh) — a super awesome project to replace the whole Node ecosystem with a faster one. It's a new JavaScript runtime, bundler, test runner, and NPM-compatible package manager. Thanks, Jared for showing how a single developer can pull big dreams!

While Bun makes JavaScript faster, Nue makes front-end development faster. Nue + Bun is really the perfect combination for a front-end developer.

Other people that inspired Nue are:

*Salvatore Sanfilippo* for this action-provoking [tweet][antirez]:

> "I look at the web today. Not as a programmer, but as a user of broken sites that are unable to obey the most basic rules of navigation and usability, terribly slow despite the hardware progress. And I can only think that modern frontend development has failed."

*Steve Jobs* for the phrase:

> "You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backward for the technology"

*Dieter Rams* for stating the obvious:

> "Less, but better"


## Aren't you reinventing the wheel? [re-inventing]
This is more like fixing a broken tire or replacing a massive pickup truck with a modern electric car.
